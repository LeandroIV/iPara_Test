# Sharing Your iPara App via Google Drive

This guide will help you share your iPara app with others using Google Drive, allowing anyone to download and install it on their Android devices.

## Step 1: Locate the APK File

The release APK file is located at:
```
android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

This is a smaller, optimized version of your app that's perfect for distribution.

2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click the "+ New" button in the top-left corner
4. Select "File upload"
5. Navigate to the APK file location and select `iPara_app_release.apk` (created by the preparation script)
6. Wait for the upload to complete

## Step 3: Set Sharing Permissions

1. Right-click on the uploaded APK file in Google Drive
2. Select "Share"
3. In the sharing dialog, click "Change to anyone with the link"
4. Set the permission to "Viewer" (this allows people to download but not edit)
5. Click "Copy link"
6. Click "Done"

## Step 4: Share the Link

You can now share this link with anyone you want to install your app:
- Via email
- Through messaging apps
- On social media
- On your website

## Step 5: Create a QR Code (Optional)

To make it easier for people to access your app:
1. Go to a QR code generator website (like [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/))
2. Paste your Google Drive link
3. Generate the QR code
